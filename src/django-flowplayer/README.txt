Django Flowplayer
=================

This is a mediaplayer app for Django projects using the flowplayer flash player.

For installation instructions, see the file "INSTALL.txt" in this
directory; for instructions on how to use this application, and on
what it provides, see the file "overview.txt" in the "docs/"
directory.

Starting as a fork of django-videoplayer, the purpose of this app is to provide a more
complete implementation of flowplayer configuration from within the Django framework.
Currently it is possible to output multiple player 'classes' using an optional tag
allowing different media to be presented in different ways.
