Django Flowplayer
=================

A mediaplayer application for `Django`_ projects using the flowplayer flash player
to display media files of different types on your site. Originally based on the
django-videoplayer application this has support for display of audio-specific players
with the aim being to allow complete control of the flowplayer instances via Django.

Installation
============

Installing an official release
------------------------------

Official releases are made available from
http://github.com/mfitzp/django-flowplayer

Source distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the .zip distribution file and unpack it. Inside is a script
named ``setup.py``. Enter this command::

   python setup.py install

...and the package will install automatically. 

Alternatively just copy the ``flowplayer`` directory into your path.

Installing the development version
----------------------------------

To get the development version for development you can git clone from the public url:

   git clone git://github.com/mfitzp/django-flowplayer.git

Add the resulting folder to your `PYTHONPATH`_ or symlink (`junction`_,
if you're on Windows) the ``flowplayer`` directory inside it into a
directory which is on your PYTHONPATH, such as your Python
installation's ``site-packages`` directory.

You can verify that the application is available on your PYTHONPATH by
opening a Python interpreter and entering the following commands::

   >>> import flowplayer
   >>> flowplayer.VERSION
   (0, 3, 'pre')

.. caution::

   The development version may contain bugs which are not present in the
   release version and introduce backwards-incompatible changes.

   3. Streaming audio? Download http://flowplayer.org/plugins/streaming/audio.html
   4. Unpack the files and pull all of them in a directory in your media path (e.g. /media/flowplayer)
   5. Add a script tag to your template head, pointing at the .js file (in /media/flowplayer)
   6. In your settings.py set the correct value for FLOWPLAYER_URL
   7. Add the css ( /media/css/example.css ) to your site css or roll your own
   8. Load the tags into a template and try it out!

That's it!


Settings
========

Some of the application's behaviour can be configured by adding the
appropriate settings to your project's settings file.

The following settings are available:

FLOWPLAYER_URL
--------------

The url to the flowplayer flash file (and -controls and audio plugins).

FLOWPLAYER_CONFIG
--------------

This is a dict defining the config settings for the play for a given player type.
The root entry is the type e.g 'audio' with the configuration entries following the 
same hierarchy as defined in the flowplayer docs.

Any settings in 'default' will apply to all players (settings are merged with 
any named player you define). See below for an example:

FLOWPLAYER_CONFIG = {
                        'default' : 
                            { 'clip' : { 'autoPlay':'false' },
                              'plugins' : { 'controls' : { 'playlist': 'true' } } 
                            },
                        
                        'audio' : 
                            { 'clip' :
                                { 'autoPlay':'false' }
                            },
                    }


Template tags
=============

The ``flowplayer.templatetags.flowplayer_tags`` module defines the
(only!) flowplayer tag for displaying a mediaplayer instance.

Tag reference
-------------

flowplayer
~~~~~~~~~~

Outputs a flowplayer mediaplayer instance for a given url/playlist array, with an optional
'playertype' parameter for specifying audio player display.  When provided 
playertype is used to add an additional CSS class to the player, in the form
flowplayer<playertype>, allowing for specific layouts for given mediatypes. 

See example.css in the media/css folder for a demonstration.

Usage::

   {% flowplayer media playertype %}

Examples::

   {% flowplayer object.url %}
   {% flowplayer http://example.com/video.flv %}
   {% flowplayer http://example.com/audio.mp3 audio %}
   {% flowplayer array_of_urls %}
